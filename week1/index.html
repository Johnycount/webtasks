			<td style="font-size: 110%; font-family: cursive;">The BMW X5 is the first-generation BMW X5 mid-sized luxury crossover SUV. It was produced from 1999-2006[2] and was replaced by the BMW E70. The E53 was developed at a time when BMW still owned Land Rover and as such shares many components and designs with both the Land Rover Range Rover L322 model (specifically the Hill Descent System and Off Road Engine Management system) and the BMW E39 5 Series (specifically engines and electronic systems). The entire in-car entertainment system (Radio Function, Navigation System, Television and Telecommunications systems) are shared with other BMWs and L322.</td>
